# Hi! I'm Alif.
### I'm a Biomedical Engineering graduate specializing in software and machine learning and am currently on a path towards being a security-oriented software developer

## 🚀 About Me
As a full-stack web developer and graphic designer, I have a solid foundation in Java, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript, along with experience in wireframing applications like Figma. My most familiar tech stack includes PostgreSQL, React TypeScript, Hono.js, and Node.js. However, I’m dedicated to becoming a versatile developer and am actively exploring new technologies and stacks to enhance my skill set.

## 🛠 Skills

Listed here are skills I've learned during journey as a developer. Since each technology/framework have their own strengths and weaknesses, I am hoping to learn everything that I can about the intricacies of each so that I can mix and match any of these to make the most optimal stack for a lot of different use cases.
