# Hi! I'm Alif.
### I'm a Biomedical Engineering student specializing in software and machine learning and am currently on a path towards being a full-stack web developer




## 🚀 About Me
I'm a frontend developer and graphic designer with a strong foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript as well as wireframing applications such as Figma. I also possess a bit of knowledge on backend development (enough for me to create simple web CRUD APIs). I usually work with a PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and Node. I'm striving to be a versatile developer and am currently learning other stacks.
